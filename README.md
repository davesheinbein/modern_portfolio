## Recommendations

**Chris Drottar**  
_Acting VP of Software Engineering, Health SMB/DF at Internet Brands_  
"David is an excellent team member. Working as a part of my Front End Engineering team, David has proved to be adaptable, dedicated, dependable, with a growing confidence, and expending skill set. Through the years that I have worked with him so far, he has taken on tasks that vary on the difficulty spectrum and solved them all. David is frequently looking for the best way to solve a problem and delivering on time and within estimates. David was flexible enough to work with an EOL version of Angular and new react frameworks at the same building each in different simultaneous projects. His time and attention management is excellent. More recently he has begun leading milestone demonstrations intended for management and assisting peers coming into the codebases. David has always been a strong performer, and if given the chance in the future I would certainly recommend his hire."

**Budi Chandra**  
_Sr. Web Developer at Internet Brands_  
"David plays an important role in our frontend development team. He has grown from an associate to a well-established frontend developer, displaying quick wit, passion for his work, and excellent communication skills to keep projects moving forward."

**Ashwini Bauskar**  
_Executive Technology Director, Program Management & Agile Leadership_  
"Working with David has been a great experience. His technical skills and creativity made him a valuable part of our team. He effectively translated front-end requirements into streamlined systems and enhanced dynamic forms using React, Angular, and CSS. I was especially impressed by his work on the HOP UI Kit, which showcased his commitment to both quality and innovation. David also communicated effectively with the product team, consistently reviewing designs, identifying gaps, and proposing alternative technical solutions to help define use cases in more detail. He was always ready to help any team member for onboarding or for new project work, making him a great team player. His strong teamwork and collaboration helped make our project a success."

**Terence Kulik**  
_Director of Technology at Internet Brands_  
"My team was primarily backend developers, but we would regularly borrow David in order to build react bundles for our projects. David was a highly skilled front end developer, who was a pleasure to work with. We could give him a design in figma or any other tool and he could create a pixel perfect implementation. If he had any concerns or questions, he would raise them immediately and proactively. If I had the opportunity, I would absolutely work with David again."

**Zohreh Malek**  
_Sr. Technical Program/Project Manager_  
"David has collaborated closely with all of the front-end developers on my team over the past few years. He consistently demonstrated meticulous attention to detail, a clear design vision, and an ability to identify gaps in the process, proactively communicating them to the product team. I was highly impressed with his work and would confidently recommend him for any front-end development position."
