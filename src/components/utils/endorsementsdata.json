Working as a part of my Front End Engineering team, David has proved to be adaptable, dedicated, dependable, with a growing confidence, and expending skill set. Through the years that I have worked with him so far, he has taken on tasks that vary on the difficulty spectrum and solved them all. David is frequently looking for the best way to solve a problem and delivering on time and within estimates. David was flexible enough to work with an EOL version of Angular and new react frameworks at the same building each in different simultaneous projects. His time and attention management is excellent,. More recently he has begun leading milestone demonstrations intended for management and assisting peers coming into the codebases.. David has always been a strong performer, and if given the chance in the future I would certainly recommend his hire.",
